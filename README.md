# PRS_tutorial_ARK

8/6/20

In this repo I've compiled scripts from the PRS tutorial to be run on sample data from the tutorial: https://choishingwan.github.io/PRS-Tutorial/.

I'm using it to better understand how plink and PRSice work (and compare to one another)

The scripts are designed to be run in this order:
1. run_QC.sh
1. run_PRS_plink.sh OR run_PRS_PRSice.sh

The R scripts are run from within these .sh scripts.
